# Hydroponic Tomato Cultivation Optimization

## Background:


Hydroponic farming presents a revolutionary approach to agriculture, offering precise nutrient management and water usage while minimizing land and resource requirements. This project explores the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in optimizing tomato growth within hydroponic systems. By leveraging AI technology, we aim to enhance yield and quality while promoting sustainable agricultural practices.

## Objectives:

The primary objective of this project is to develop an AI model capable of determining the optimal nutrient uptake, water usage, and greenhouse gas emissions for hydroponic tomato plants. By utilizing data-driven insights, our model is designed to minimize waste and maximize efficiency, thereby paving the way for a more sustainable agricultural future. Additionally, we aim to address the challenges of traditional farming by providing a scalable solution for consistent and high-quality tomato production.

SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

SDG 13: Climate Action

SDG 15: Life on Land

## Feature Engineering:

Integrating two distinct datasets required meticulous data manipulation and cleansing to ensure data integrity. We harmonized disparate data structures, rectified inconsistencies, and eliminated irrelevant entries. Additionally, we crafted a novel feature to encapsulate the developmental phase of the plants, providing a dynamic overview of the plant's lifecycle and enhancing the dataset's analytical value.

## Model:

For this project, we selected the Random Forest algorithm due to its proficiency in handling high-dimensional data and intricate relationships among variables in hydroponic tomato cultivation. Random Forest's ensemble learning method enables processing of a large number of input variables without variable deletion, making it ideal for our dataset. Its ability to manage non-linear relationships between variables and provide accurate predictions further motivated our choice.

## Hyperparameter Tuning:

To refine the model, particularly for predicting CO2 and CH4 emissions accurately, we employed Randomized Grid Search for hyperparameter tuning. This method efficiently explores the hyperparameter space without exhaustive computation, leading to enhanced model precision in estimating greenhouse gas emissions.

## Output:

Utilizing the Random Forest algorithm and Randomized Grid Search significantly enhances hydroponic tomato cultivation's sustainability and efficiency. By optimizing nutrient compositions, establishing ideal electrical conductivity limits, and managing water usage, we minimize resource wastage and environmental impact. This project aligns technological advancements with environmental responsibility, showcasing a model for future sustainable farming practices.
